                        True to its noble ideal Pro Bono et Vero (for the Good and the True), St. Joseph’s College has always upheld and radiated Goodness and Truth in its endeavour to impart quality in higher education. This educational establishment has been instrumental in churning out thousands of truly educated persons, physically fit and intellectually well equipped. Thus, this College stands for what is best in education. The College blazon is a distinctive badge expressing its aim and ideal. It bears azure, with Tiruchirappalli Rock and College Church for distinctive features. The conspicuous Palm Tree in the middle is the Emblem of the East. It bears in fesse, a bow, and above it is the monogram of the Society of Jesus. Its crest is a royal crown and a lily issuant, both in honour of the college Patron, St. Joseph, the crown to signify that he was of David’s royal blood, and the lily to signify his spotless purity. Thus the whole in ordinary language would read: The College of St. Joseph conducted by the Members of the Society of Jesus at Tiruchirappalli in the East.
